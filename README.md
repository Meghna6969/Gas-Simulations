# Gases and Collisions Simulation
    - Precise control of particles in the scene
    - Data conversion in most of the important physics units
    - Collision counter in a given time
    - Precise control over volume of the container in nano meters
    - Relative Heating vs Specific Temperature heating
    - Time controls that allow for pausing, next frame, simulation speed change
    - Visual feedback of Pressure with the container
    - Light weight, easy accessible on multiple screen
    - 3 dimensional analysis with all three axes in play
    - Powered by THREE.js for better support and stability with most browsers

# Maxwell-Boltzmann Simulation
    - Precise control over particles
    - Two types of particles with different masses
    - Specific temperature on the container
    - Variable Volume control with its effects on pressure and temperature
    - Seperate access of velocity componenets for both types of particles
    - Gravitational pull on particles that simulate real world gases
    - Effusion demonstrated with a hole in the container
    - Precise collision between particles that follow physical rules of momentum and impluse
    - **Real-time Maxwell-Boltzmann Graphs**
        - Kinetic Energy vs Particle Count
        - Speed vs Particle Count
    - Average Speed over an area for all the particles
    - Support for real world units
    - Precise time control over the rendering of the simulation
    - Time dilation with the simulation speed
    - 3 dimensional analysis with all three axes in play
    - Powered by THREE.js for better support and stability with most browsers

### Libraries Used
    - **THREE.js** (r128): 3D rendering and graphics
    - No libaries for graphs for better support and stability

### Physics Concepts
    - Momentum/Impulse with particle collisions
    - Thermodynamics
    - Gravitational Stratification (Gravitational force on Vy of particles)
    - Pressure, Volume, and Temperature
    
### IMPORTANT!! which the simulation is reliable, its math calculations might be very off. Please double check the values!
